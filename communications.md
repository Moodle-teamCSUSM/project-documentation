### Document Objective

To record all methods used for communications including proper project-change procedures.

### Communication Applications

For this project, we will communicate through [Slack](http://slack.com]) while using [Asana](http://asana.com) to maintain all to-do lists. In addition, all project changes and issues will be handled through GitHub Issues.

#### Slack

If you haven't already done so, send [me](mailto:jstngoulet@me.com) an email for the Slack Invite. There, you will be placed in the proper channels according to your teams (as defined in the [Roles](Roles.md#project-role-breakdown -chart)).

##### Teams

You will notice that different people are in different channels according to the respective teams. You can use this channel, as well as any additional, for third party integrations, standard Communications and even as reminder spaces for you to use in the future.

##### Third-Party Integrations

If you are unable to add a third party integration due to improper permissions, contact the [Project Lead](mailto:jstngoulet@me.com) by emailing him, or using [Slack](https://sideproject-teamcsusm.slack.com/team/tizzle). Third Party integrations are recommended as they may help you in a variety of ways. Asana, for example, integrates with Slack.

##### Extra Invites

If you want to invite someone else to this project, you may as long as it is before **Feb 27, 2017**. This is the point where non-active members are removed from the team as well (as shown in the [Project Plan](project-plan.md#timeline)). Note that they must also be added to all proper teams by the Project Lead.

#### Asana

Asana is a task management software tool that allows multiple users to manage tasks with one-to-many projects. We will be using it to assign and manage tasks within our smaller groups so that duplication of tasks is never an issue.

##### Invites

In order to be included in Asana, you must be directly invited into the team. Please fill out the table below with your email so that you may be added and so other team members may email you should any questions arise (and Slack may be down).

#### GitHub Issues

If you find a bug in the project, find a design/implementation flaw, or something isn't working the way the documentation says it should work, create a GitHub issue for the relative repository. The related team is in charge of responding to your request as soon as possible. When the issue is fixed, the issue should be closed.

#### Communication while Product Testing

Fellow team members may need to test on different platforms in addition to the original team responsible. The email you list below will also be used for testing via TestFlight - Apple's testing system for developers, and Google's equivalent (if applicable). Please do not use your school email as this may expire during the project duration.
