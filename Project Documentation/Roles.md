### Document Objective

Describes roles of each individual, including what they are responsible for and each group member name. See the [Communications]('../README.md') document for contact information for each participant.

### Team Breakdown Chart

The chart shown below breaks down all roles. Note that there will only be one project lead. In addition, the gray circles indicate that everyone will participate in decisions relating to that group. For example, every team member will contribute to the Database Design and the Design of each product (Mobile applications and Web).

As shown in the chart, the positions are as follows:

#### Product Lead

> The product lead is in charge of determining deadlines, creating documentation as it relates to the project goals, maintaining accurate records of the project and ensuring each participant is actively participating to ensure their credit is enacted.

#### Database Management

> The Database Management team is in charge of ensuring an accurate database is created using standardized mechanisms. Since we will be creating our own MoodleÂ® theme, we will have to maintain a sample database of data - including analytics showing our our theme is used.

> Required documentation the Database Management team must provide include (but are not limited to):

> - ERDs (Entity Relationship Diagrams)
> - TFDs (Task Flow Diagrams)
> - Table Description Documentation
> - Normalization Procedures
> - Sample Queries with Descriptions

#### Design Team

> The Design team is in charge of creating how the product will look for both Administrative and Student Users (for full user chart with descriptions, see the Stakeholder list). This includes the following (but not limited to):

> - Color Palette
> - Menu Locations
> - Font Used (must be documented)
> - Images Used
> - Page Interaction Diagrams (Interactive PDF?)
> - Use Cases
> - Wireframes

#### Web Development Team

> This team is broken down into 2 parts

> - UI
> - Backend

> The purpose is that each user should have a primary area of focus to reduce workload. Note that these teams may work together at times, but each team is responsible for their assigned duties.

> ##### UI Team

> The UI Team is in charge of implementing the User Interface as described in the wireframe documentation and the page interaction diagrams. The UI Team must use the data gathered by the Design Team to match **specifically** what was discussed. This may include:

> - Menu Style
> - Animations
> - Background Styles
> - Fonts
> - Colors

> To submit a change to the Design Team, a new issue must be opened in GitHub, as mentioned in the [Communications Document](Roles.md). This team works closely to the Backend team for sharing classes, ids, and other information needed to ensure a fluid workspace. Heavy focus on CSS and Javascript.

> ##### Backend Team

> This team is in charge of ensuring the pages actually work. This team will implement the pages required as per the Page Interaction Diagram and Task Flow Diagrams. Some key details include:

> - Building the skeleton of the webpage
> - Connecting and implementing database queries and results
> - Managing Page Interaction
> - Incorporating Analytics

> Just like the UI Team, the Backend Team must open a GitHub issue for any change not described in the documentation. This team works closely with the UI Team to provide a seamless experience. Heavy Focus on HTML, SQL and PHP (some JS may be required).
