### Main Objectives
To gain experience working with a variety of languages including REACT Native, Objective-C/Swift 3.0, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, HTML, JSON, MySQL, and more.

Proper Documentation is required. All documnetation must be recorded in Markdown. Documentation includes wireframes, Data Flow Diagrams/Information Flow Diagrams (DFD/IFD), Task Flow Diagrams (TFD), Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), and Porject Mangement documentation such as Communications Document, Risk Assesments, Roles/Role Descriptions, Requirements, Scope Management Plan, Plan Summary and a User-Manual for all users (since we will have an admin and a user side).

### Possible Options
Since we want to create a cross-platform experience (web and mobile), we have several openings. Below are some I have thought of (You may add more). Voting will occur on January 3rd (via Slack).

####  Option 1 - Centralized Social Network
##### A social network that combines several social feeds into one.
The project will incorperate many social networks and allow a user to view feed (by their own sorting). A user can sign into their twitter account, facebook account, instagram account and more and recieve a centralized feed from all of them. When a user wishes to post, They may set a default setting to post to particular, or all, of the social netwroks they are signed into.
Possible APIs include each network's API for integration, Anayltics integration (along with customized analytics for our own use).
