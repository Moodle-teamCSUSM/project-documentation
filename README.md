### Main Objectives
To gain experience working with a variety of languages including REACT Native, Objective-C/Swift 3.0, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, HTML, JSON, MySQL, and more.

Proper Documentation is required. All documnetation must be recorded in Markdown. Documentation includes wireframes, Data Flow Diagrams/Information Flow Diagrams (DFD/IFD), Task Flow Diagrams (TFD), Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), and Porject Mangement documentation such as Communications Document, Risk Assesments, Roles/Role Descriptions, Requirements, Scope Management Plan, Plan Summary and a User-Manual for all users (since we will have an admin and a user side).

Since there are several key elements to this project, we will have a formailzed version control system, in addition to framworks that support the version control system with multiple users. For mobile development, we will be using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/https://cocoapods.org/) for Objective-C. Android is not yet determined (Suggestions?).

### Possible Options
Since we want to create a cross-platform experience (web and mobile), we have several openings. Below are some I have thought of (You may add more). Voting will occur on January 3rd (via Slack).

####  Option 1 - Centralized Social Network
##### A social network that combines several social feeds into one.
The project will incorperate many social networks and allow a user to view feed (by their own sorting). A user can sign into their twitter account, facebook account, instagram account and more and recieve a centralized feed from all of them. When a user wishes to post, They may set a default setting to post to particular, or all, of the social netwroks they are signed into.
Possible APIs include each network's API for integration, Anayltics integration (along with customized analytics for our own use), others as needed..

####  Option 2 - Recreation of BeerHopper
##### Starting with a previously created foundation, this social network combines beer drinkers with beer makers.
This project will take what has already been created (web) and use the same concepts learned to build the site in a more efficient manner. Since this application is cross-platform, too, the mobile development side will need to be re-created to share a database with the website (or the website uses the same DB as the mobile app).
Possbible APIs include REACT Native, Google Analytics, and others as needed.

####  Option 3 - Advancement of Cougar Courses
##### Using our current school system (Moodle Based), we will transform the theme to match a mobile and user friendly experience.
This project will use our existing school system, moodle, as a base and will change the CSS to make it user friendly and much simplier to use. In addition, this theme will be ported to mobile devices in Native Applications (for experience purposes) so students can use the system with ease in this digitalized world.
Possible API's include Moodle's API and integration tools, others as needed.


### Slack Info
Note for Slack - You do not need to use your real name! We can make it fun and just use an alias! Your github will tell all (Just be consistent with your branch name and slack name! This will make it easy for the PM :) )
