# Product Management & Practice

## Product Description

A side project for our own creation - based on amassed knowledge. Poised to be a Web/Mobile application with all of the bells and whistles. If you are committed to this project, please add your name to the below table with your name and wanted role.

### Main Objectives

To gain experience working with a variety of languages including REACT Native, Objective-C/Swift 3.0, JavaScript, CSS, PHP, HTML, JSON, MySQL, and more.

In addition to working with a variety of languages (there will be separate repos under an organization when the project starts), this project will also consist of managing our backend to allow specific external connections (from our app to the database), a backend system managing web-hooks and automated scripts, a formalized informational website about the project, and some security involved.

Proper Documentation is required. All documentation must be recorded in Markdown. Documentation includes wireframes, Data Flow Diagrams/Information Flow Diagrams (DFD/IFD), Task Flow Diagrams (TFD), Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), and Project Management documentation such as Communications Document, Risk Assessments, Roles/Role Descriptions, Requirements, Scope Management Plan, Plan Summary and a User-Manual for all users (since we will have an admin and a user side).

Since there are several key elements to this project, we will have a formalized version control system, in addition to frameworks that support the version control system with multiple users. For mobile development, we will be using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/https://cocoapods.org/) for Objective-C. Android is not yet determined (Suggestions?).

In lamens terms, this project involves a lot, but will help those who may not know as much as others. This project should be viewed as a learning opportunity by everyone. Also a great addition to your project portfolio :wink:

If you feel that there is someone who has not yet been added, but has a great work ethic, finishes projects on time, and would learn a great extent by participating, run them by the product manager for verification. I am open to any suggestions.

### Possible Options

Since we want to create a cross-platform experience (web and mobile), we have several openings. Below are some I have thought of (You may add more). Voting will occur on January 3rd (via Slack).

#### Option 1 - Centralized Social Network

##### A social network that combines several social feeds into one.

The project will incorporate many social networks and allow a user to view feed (by their own sorting). A user can sign into their twitter account, facebook account, instagram account and more and receive a centralized feed from all of them. When a user wishes to post, They may set a default setting to post to particular, or all, of the social networks they are signed into. Possible APIs include each network's API for integration, Analytics integration (along with customized analytics for our own use), others as needed..

#### Option 2 - Recreation of BeerHopper

##### Starting with a previously created foundation, this social network combines beer drinkers with beer makers.

This project will take what has already been created (web) and use the same concepts learned to build the site in a more efficient manner. Since this application is cross-platform, too, the mobile development side will need to be re-created to share a database with the website (or the website uses the same DB as the mobile app). Possbible APIs include REACT Native, Google Analytics, and others as needed.

#### Option 3 - Advancement of Cougar Courses

##### Using our current school system (Moodle Based), we will transform the theme to match a mobile and user friendly experience.

This project will use our existing school system, moodle, as a base and will change the CSS to make it user friendly and much simplier to use. In addition, this theme will be ported to mobile devices in Native Applications (for experience purposes) so students can use the system with ease in this digitalized world. Possible API's include Moodle's API and integration tools, others as needed.

#### Option 4 - Diabetes Dashboard

##### Create an online tool for those with both Type I and Type II Diabetes.

This project will use our knowledge of social networking and create a tool for those with Diabetes to interact. Users would be those to keep their number history (charts and related information), blood glucose levels, appointment calendars, customized sharing of particular information, and more. Users can create social groups, participate in an organization and learn more about diabetes if they are newly diagnosed. Possible APIs include RESTful API, MongoDB, Analytics, and others as needed.

#### Option 5 - User/Administrative Appointment System

##### Create an appointment system where admins can create appointments and users can check into the appointment

This project will incorporate full scheduling of appointments capability. Using a web interface for the administrative side, users can use mobile apps to check into their appointment, change appointment times, and more. Some information that may be used includes mapping data for location based events, meeting with, which would link to a persons profile page (if they have on - professionals normally would). A base for this project could be considered as a doctor's office/urgent care check-in system. Would use push notifications to alert users when changes have occurred on the administrative side.

#### Option 6 - Course Registration System

##### Create a course registration system that has both a standard user UI and administrative UI

People want to enroll and participant in many events. The goal of this project is to create a software that can manage them easily. A user should be able to easily enroll in classes, view their schedules, transfer into different courses and more. The administrative side should be customizable to match company graphics requirements, policies and other additional procedures. Should be fully customizable on the administrative side - so much so that administrative users show what standard users can see, in addition to having administrative users without full system rights (super admins). Would use push notifications to alert of changes in the course, location, or other details the client needs to be aware of (like facility closures)

#### Option 7 - Modular Website Builder

##### Create a mobile application that allows users to create their own online resume

People want their own website. A possible solution is to make a website that is fully customizable for our users. There will be a primary search function that allows users to search for others, as well as configurable sites per user. For example, if a user went to their page, they can edit everything from the way their site looks - to the content - by either creating their own html uploads, or by using our templates. On the mobile application, the user can have easy access to mange their data including analytics. We would have to incorporate our own analytics system for this to have enhanced functionality.

### Team Breakdown

Each member will participate within 1 or 2 teams. You may nominate yourself for any team you wish - we are just trying to be balanced. Here are the breakdowns:

> #### iOS Mobile Development Team

> In charge of all iOS development in xCode and other environments. This team will pair with the Android Development Team and Web Development team for design consistency, database management and graphics implementation. Note that since we will be using REACT-Native, the language is portable enough to also work directly with the iOS Development Team. Each member must have suitable hardware for testing and running all created applications.

> Member | Main Role
> ------ | ---------
>        |
>        |
>        |

> #### Android Mobile Development Team

> In charge of all android development in Android Studio, or similar IDE. This team will pair with the iOS Development Team for design consistency, database management and graphics implementation. Note that since we will be using REACT-Native, the language is portable enough to also work directly with the iOS Development Team. Each member must have suitable hardware for testing and running all created applications.

> Member | Main Role
> ------ | ---------
>        |
>        |
>        |

> #### Web Development Team

> In charge of creating an informative website, in addition to a functional website, that works concurrently with the Mobile Development Teams for design consistency, database management and graphics implementation. Each member must have suitable hardware/software for testing and running all created applications. Major browsers to support (in full) - Chrome, Safari, Firefox.
